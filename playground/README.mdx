# Elicit Confirmation

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicai.pro/workshops/day-3-4-advanced-mcp-features/elicit-confirmation~oaha2" />

üë®‚Äçüíº When users interact with our system, they sometimes initiate actions that have significant consequences (like deleting a tag or entry). To ensure users don't accidentally lose something important, we need to pause and ask for explicit confirmation before proceeding.

This is where **elicitation** comes in. Instead of making assumptions, our MCP server can make a structured elicitation request. This lets us ask the user for confirmation in a way that's both clear and robust, and ensures the server only proceeds if the user truly intends to take the action.

```js
const result = await agent.server.server.elicitInput({
	message: `Are you sure you want to delete sandwich "The Big Dipper" (ID: 42)?`,
	requestedSchema: {
		type: 'object',
		properties: {
			confirmed: {
				type: 'boolean',
				description: 'Whether to confirm the action',
			},
		},
	},
})
const confirmed =
	result.action === 'accept' && result.content?.confirmed === true

if (!confirmed) {
	const structuredContent = { success: false, sandwich: existingSandwich }
	return {
		structuredContent,
		content: [
			{
				type: 'text',
				text: `Deleting sandwich "The Big Dipper" (ID: 42) rejected by the user.`,
			},
			{
				type: 'resource_link',
				uri: `bobby-sandys://sandwiches/${existingSandwich.id}`,
				name: existingSandwich.name,
				mimeType: 'application/json',
			},
			{
				type: 'text',
				text: JSON.stringify(structuredContent),
			},
		],
	}
}
```

<callout-success>
	If the user does not confirm, the system gracefully cancels the action and
	provides clear feedback (no sandwiches are harmed)!
</callout-success>

Note you will also want to verify that the client has elicitation capabilities, and if they do not, then just proceed.

```ts
// the server.server is how the MCP SDK exposes the underlying server
// instance for more advanced APIs like this one.
const capabilities = agent.server.server.getClientCapabilities()
if (capabilities?.elicitation) {
	// do the elicitation
} else {
	// proceed without elicitation
}
```

This approach ensures users are always in control of important actions, and the system responds with empathy and clarity.

Test this one out by using the `delete_tag` tool.

implement this.
